\usage{
TransferData(anchorset, refdata, reduction = "pcaproject",
  l2.norm = FALSE, dims = 1:30, k.weight = 50, sd.weight = 1,
  eps = 0, do.cpp = TRUE, verbose = TRUE, slot = "data")
}
\arguments{
\item{anchorset}{Results from FindTransferAnchors}

\item{refdata}{Data to transfer. Should be either a vector where the names correspond to
reference cells, or a matrix, where the column names correspond to the reference cells.}

\item{reduction}{Dimensional reduction to use for the weighting. Options are:
\itemize{
   \item{pcaproject: Use the projected PCA used for anchor building}
   \item{pca: Use an internal PCA on the query only}
   \item{cca: Use the CCA used for anchor building}
}}

\item{l2.norm}{Perform L2 normalization on the cell embeddings after dimensional reduction}

\item{dims}{Number of PCs to use in the weighting procedure}

\item{k.weight}{Number of neighbors to consider when weighting}

\item{sd.weight}{Controls the bandwidth of the Gaussian kernel for weighting}

\item{eps}{Error bound on the neighbor finding algorithm (from RANN)}

\item{do.cpp}{Run cpp code where applicable}

\item{verbose}{Print progress bars and output}

\item{slot}{Slot to store the imputed data}
}
\value{
If refdata is a vector, returns a dataframe with label predictions. If refdata is a
matrix, returns an Assay object where the imputed data has been stored in the provided slot.
